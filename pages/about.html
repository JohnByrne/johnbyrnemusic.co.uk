    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>John Byrne is a guitarist and multi-instrumentalist hailing from Liverpool composing and playing music that fans of Frank Zappa, Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Joe Bonamassa, Animals As Leaders and John Scofield will appreciate.</p>

    <p>Playing for over 30 years, John has racked up an impressive skillset and repertoire of sounds and genres including Blues, Classical, Flamenco, Funk, Fusion, Jazz, Rock, Progressive and anything inbetween. Favouring an aggressive and emotive style, John is a natural improviser and has performed hundreds of gigs as part of bands and solo performing his own compositions as well as arrangements of popular hits.</p>

    <p>John has now completed 4 albums, with latest guitar-focused record "Recurring Dream" set to hit streaming services in 2024. Each record has stepped up the genre bending style and manic lead playing, as well as improving arrangements and polishing the production.</p>
